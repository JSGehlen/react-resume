# This is mobile first-resume app created with React

I focused on building my own reusable React components instead of using component libraries such as Material UI etc. This gave me freedom to use my own styling without retyping the same code on multiple components. Styling was mostly done with Styled-Components with a few .scss file exceptions.

Components are animated using the Framer Motion component library.

User sensitive material like my personal information is stored and fetched from Contetful.

The app is hosted in Netlify and can be seen [here](https://developer-resume.tech/)
